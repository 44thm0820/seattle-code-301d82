- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic, `.sort()`
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 4 of Code 301, students will:

- Describe and Define:
  - Event
  - Forms
  - Event Listeners
  - Event Handlers
  - event.target
- Understand how to use a `form` in a React application
- Be able to send information collected from a form into a child component

## Notes

1. What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler?

1. If I am listening for an onChange on the input field, how to I access the value that the user is typing in?

1. If the form is my child component, how do I send the information collected from that form up to the parent component?
